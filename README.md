Files for setting up a Raspberry Pi

Setting up a Raspberry Pi should be easier.

A new system has no shortcuts and often there are many packages to install. It can be annoying to go down a check-list when a good old .sh script will get the job done. That's the point of this repo: a place to keep files which can be wgotten as soon as the Pi gets online.

Files to put here first:
  .bash stuff,
  apt-setup.sh (initial apt-get commands),
  apt-cv.sh (openCV dev setup)
